                        </p>
                        <p>Important reminder:</p>
                        <p>We hereby remind you that:</p>
                        <p>
                            1. The digital assets themselves are not offered by
                            any financial institution, corporation or the
                            Gateway;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. The digital asset market is new and unconfirmed,
                            and will not necessarily expand;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3. Digital assets are primarily used by speculators,
                            and are used relatively less on retail and
                            commercial markets; digital asset transactions are
                            highly risky, due to the fact that they are traded
                            throughout 24-hour a day without limits on the rise
                            or fall in price, and market makers and global
                            government policies may cause major fluctuations in
                            their prices;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4. Digital asset transactions may be suspended or
                            prohibited at any time due to the enactment or
                            modification of national laws, regulations and
                            regulatory documents. Digital assets trading is
                            highly risky and therefore not suitable for the vast
                            majority of people. You acknowledge and understand
                            that investment in digital assets may result in
                            partial or total loss of your investment and
                            therefore you are advised to decide the amount of
                            your investment on the basis of your loss-bearing
                            capacity. You acknowledge and understand that
                            digital assets may generate derivative risks.
                            Therefore, if you have any doubt, you are advised to
                            seek assistance from a financial adviser first.
                            Furthermore, aside from the above-mentioned risks,
                            there may also be unpredictable risks. Therefore,
                            you are advised to carefully consider and use clear
                            judgment to assess your financial position and the
                            abovementioned risks before making any decisions on
                            buying and selling digital assets; any and all
                            losses arising therefrom will be borne by you and we
                            shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever.
                        </p>
